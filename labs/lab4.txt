Tmux Tutorial

Watch it!

You are already in a tmux session. If you weren't, you could apt-install tmux, then type the command tmux to get started. But the first thing we need to practice is a two-step process to enter into the command mode of tmux. Follow these steps:

Hold the Ctrl key
Tap the B key
Take your hands off the keyboard (alias HOK)
Practice doing this seven times.

Now you are ready to learn some of the most essential tmux commands.

For each of the following characters, enter the tmux command sequence (Ctrl B, HOK), then push the character. Note, not all of the characters are single-button presses. For example: % can be done by hitting the keyboard buttons Shift and 5.

% - Vertical Split
" - Horizontal Split
z - Zoom/Unzoom
← - Move cursor leftwards one pane
↑ - Move cursor upwards one pane
→ - Move cursor rightwards one pane
↓ - Move cursor downwards one pane
[ - Scrollback (type q to exit)
? - Show the list of available tmux commands (type q to exit)
To exit out of a tmux pane, you can simply type the word exit, logout, or hit the key sequence Ctrl D.
